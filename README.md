## Title of the Project
AI-Enabled Smart Bus System for Intelligent Student Transportation and Real-Time Monitoring

**Small Description About the Project**

The Smart Bus System integrates AI and IoT-based automation to streamline student transportation, ensuring real-time safety, accurate attendance, and transparent monitoring. The system replaces manual processes with QR-based boarding, intelligent seat allocation, GPS tracking, and AI-powered overspeed/anomaly detection, improving the overall experience for students, parents, and administrators.


## About
The AI-Enabled Smart Bus System is a software-driven project designed to automate and secure the student transportation workflow. Traditional bus management requires manual attendance, uncertain seat availability, and limited visibility for parents and admin.
This project overcomes these challenges by integrating:

QR code–based student authentication

Real-time seat tracking and bus full-detection

Swarm-based same-route bus suggestion

GPS-enabled live bus monitoring dashboard

AI-powered overspeed and anomaly detection

Instant notifications to parents

Through a unified software interface, the system enhances safety, reduces human error, and offers transparency throughout the journey.

## Features

✔ QR code–based boarding authentication

✔ Real-time seat allocation and occupancy status

✔ Swarm-based route suggestion when bus is full

✔ Live GPS tracking with dashboard view

✔ AI-based overspeed & anomaly detection

✔ Instant notifications to parents

✔ Cloud-synchronized records and logs

✔ Fully software-based — no hardware dependency

## Requirements

## Results and Impact

The Smart Bus System improves transparency, accuracy, and safety in student transportation.
Its AI-powered monitoring ensures early detection of risky driving behaviors, and the automated QR-based attendance removes manual errors.

The system:
• Enhances trust for parents

• Reduces administrative workload

• Optimizes bus utilization via swarm-based bus allocation

• Increases safety through real-time AI alerts

This project demonstrates the potential of AI + IoT software systems to revolutionize institutional mobility and student safety.
